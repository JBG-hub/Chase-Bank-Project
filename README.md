# Data Structure Overview

# Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
Chase had deposit growth each year from 2010-2016, culminitating in total deposits of $1.1B for 2016 alone. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of deposits was 10.6% during this time. This growth is not attributable to branch openings, as the total operating branches in 2010 is nearly identical to the operating branches in 2016. This suggests the positive growth is likely driven by customer growth and increased customer activity at existing branches. The U.S. economy is attributing to deposit growth as well, as since the 2008 financial crisis the U.S. has seen positive GDP growth rates from 2010-2016.

Below is the Chase business overview dashboard, which can be viewed here.

### Deposit Growth Analysis
- The company's total deposits had year-over-year (YoY) increases of 18%, 11%, 10%, 12%, 3%, and 9% from 2011-2016 respectively. The biggest YoY occured in 2011 and YoY percentages remained in double digits for four consecutive years. However, the latest years 2015-2016 show the growth rate cooled off to single-digit percentages, dipping as low as 3% in 2015. This raises concern that the CAGR rate of 10.6% may not be a sustainable forecast if growth continues to trend downward. 
- Comparing branches' 2016 deposits to 2010 deposits, 4,411 out of 4,520 branches (98%) experienced an increase in deposits. Of the 109 branches with declining deposits, 2010 and 2016 deposits totaled $22M and $15M respectively. 17 States had at least one declining branch.
- The company exceeded $1B in annual deposits in 2015 and 2016. The average annual deposits for the timespan 2010-2016 was $0.9B. In 2016, the $1.1B annual deposit ranked Chase as the second largest bank by total deposits, ranking only behind Bank of America ($1.2B) according to FDIC.

### Regional Opportunities
- New York is the number one contributing state by deposits, and by a significant margin. New York accounted for $2.9B deposits from 2010-2016, which represents 47% of the $6.1B total deposits recorded across all states. The next largest state by deposits is Texas with $0.9B. 
- As of 2016, the company is operating in 23 different states. The three most populated states that Chase does not operate in are Pennsylvania, North Carolina, and Virginia, which rank 6th, 9th and 12th respectively according to census.gov estimates for 2016. Due to their population and major cities, these states offer lots of expansion opportunity.
- The company has over 500 branches in each of California, New York and Texas. While Florida rivals these states in terms of population according to census.gov, in terms of branch count Florida was lagging with only 214 branches. This low branch count led to Florida accounting for the 9th most total deposits, despite a population ranking 3rd. It is recommended to expand inside Florida to fully realize the deposit potential of this populous state.
  
### Urban Density Trends
