# Data Structure Overview

# Executive Summary
### Overview of Findings
Chase had deposit growth each year from 2010-2016, culminitating in total deposits of $1.1B for 2016 alone. The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of deposits was 10.6% during this time. This growth is not attributable to branch openings, as the total operating branches in 2010 is nearly identical to the operating branches in 2016. This suggests the positive growth is likely driven by customer growth and increased customer activity at existing branches. The U.S. economy is attributing to deposit growth as well, as since the 2008 financial crisis the U.S. has seen positive GDP growth rates from 2010-2016.

### Deposit Growth Analysis
- The company's total deposits had year-over-year (YoY) increases of 18%, 11%, 10%, 12%, 3%, and 9% from 2011-2016 respectively. The biggest YoY occured in 2011 and YoY percentages remained in double digits for four consecutive years. However, the latest years 2015-2016 show the growth rate cooled off to single-digit percentages, dipping as low as 3% in 2015. This raises concern that the CAGR rate of 10.6% may not be a sustainable forecast if growth continues to trend downward. 
- Comparing branches' 2016 deposits to 2010 deposits, 4,411 out of 4,520 branches (98%) experienced an increase in deposits. Of the 109 branches with declining deposits, 2010 and 2016 deposits totaled $22M and $15M respectively. 17 States had at least one declining branch.
- With Chase experiencing growth from 2010-2016, the company exceeded $1B in annual deposits twice in the most recent two years. The average annual deposits for 2010-2016 was around $0.9B. 

### Regional Opportunities
- New York is the state with the largest amount of deposits, and by a considerable margin.
- States with the highest population generally have the most bank branches.
- Florida
- Population shifting Southward and Westward, these regions offer higher potential.
